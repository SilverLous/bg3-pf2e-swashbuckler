Attempt to Tumble Through a creature at least one size category larger than you, using the following effects.Critical Success You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure. If you successfully pass through the target's square, the target gains weakness to your precision damage equal to half your level, which lasts until the end of your turn.Success As success, but the weakness applies only against the next attack you make against the target.Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.Critical Failure As failure, and you fall prone. |             |
|       1 | Bon Mot                      | You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them.                                                                                      | Diplomacy Feat    | ✅      | You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target's Will DC.Critical Success The target is distracted and takes a –3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.Success As critical success, but the penalty is –2.Critical Failure Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.                                                         |             |
